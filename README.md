A music server for cataloguing and exploring large music libraries.

Visit [the documentation](https://repertoire.readthedocs.io) to get started!

**Currently unreleased.**

Note: This project is a sandbox project, in the sense that I am using it to try
out cool new ideas and tools. Feature work is a second priority. This does not
mean that feature work will not occur! But expect it to be slow.
