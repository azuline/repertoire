A music server for cataloguing and exploring large music libraries.

**Unreleased WIP Edition**

## Background

This project is a sandbox project, in the sense that we are using it to
experiment with cool new ideas and technologies. Feature work is a second
priority to extracting educational value out of this codebase.

This does not mean that feature work will not occur--progress will still occur.
But expect it to be slow.

On the flip side, we treat codebase health as a top priority. We take care to
keep complexity low, to document the project thoroughly, and to have a high
quality developer workflow.

Unrequested external PRs will likely not be accepted. If you wish to make a PR,
please open an issue ticket first to coordinate with maintainers.

### Scratchpad

Since GQL API can create release, need to have functions to scan its tracks for
cover art and/or upload art.
